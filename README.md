# Sudoku Solver
 Vectorized Sudoku Solver Implementation Using RISC-V Vector ISA.

[This](https://github.com/s-m-sharjeel/Sudoku-Solver/blob/main/Vectorized%20Sudoku%20Solver%20Implementation%20Using%20RISC-V%20Vector%20ISA.pdf) paper presents the design, implementation, and performance analysis of a vectorized 64x64 Sudoku solver using the RISC-V Vector Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The solver leverages vectorized operations to enhance the efficiency of the backtracking algorithm used for solving Sudoku puzzles. This study outlines the conversion process from high-level C code to vectorized assembly code, the challenges encountered, and the performance gains achieved through vectorization.
